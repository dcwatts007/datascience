from lets_plot import *

LetsPlot.setup_html(isolated_frame=True)
```


```{python}
# Learn morea about Code Cells: https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-jupyter.html

# Include and execute your code here
sqlite_file = 'lahmansbaseballdb.sqlite'
# this file must be in the same location as your .qmd or .py file

## QUESTION 1

__Write an SQL query that pulls in the batting average table. Then, with Python Pandas code create a dataframe that contains playerID, yearID, and batting average for players with at least 10 at bat that year. Sort the dataframe from highest batting average to lowest, and then by playerid alphabetically. Show the top 5 results in your report.__

_type your results and analysis here_

```{python}
# Execute an SQL query to pull in the data
q = """SELECT *
        FROM batting
    """
df_batting = pd.read_sql_query(q, con)
df.query("'At Bats' >= 10")
```

```{python}
# Now use pandas code to work with the 'df_batting' data frame and complete the task


```

## QUESTION 2

__Now use Python Pandas to calculate the batting average for players over their entire careers (all years combined). Only include players with at least 100 at bats over their entire career, and print the top 5 results.__

_Describe your results and analysis here_

```{python}
# Include and execute your pandas code code here. (You already read in the batting table in Question 1)


```
